# Image Auto Captioning Project

## Overview
This project implements an Image Auto Captioning system designed to automatically generate descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly using architectures such as CNN for feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or GRU units for caption generation.

## Objectives
- Automatically generate accurate and contextually relevant captions for images.
- Employ state-of-the-art deep learning models to achieve effective image understanding and description generation.

## Technical Approach
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loading and preprocessing image datasets.
   - Processing textual caption data (tokenization, embedding).

2. **Model Architecture**
   - CNN for extracting image features.
   - RNN (LSTM or GRU) to generate coherent and contextually relevant captions based on extracted features.

3. **Training and Evaluation**
   - Training the combined CNN-RNN model on a dataset of image-caption pairs.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as BLEU score, CIDEr, or ROUGE.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, PIL (Pillow)

## Setup and Usage
- Clone or download the notebook `Image_Auto_Captioning.ipynb`.
- Ensure dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- Run the notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment to execute the image captioning workflow.
